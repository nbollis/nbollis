## Hi there! I'm Nic üëã

I'm a chemist and open-source developer passionate about mass spectrometry, bioinformatics, and building tools that bridge proteomics and epitranscriptomics.

### üî¨ Research Interests

- **Proteomics & Epitranscriptomics**: I study how proteins and RNA are modified, digested, and identified via high-resolution LC-MS/MS workflows.
- **Spectral Analysis**: My work thus far includes spectral averaging, chimeric spectra deconvolution, and charge state prediction.
- **FDR & Post-processing**: I'm especially interested in machine learning approaches to false discovery rate control for proteomic search identifications. 

Check out my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&user=-LYof70AAAAJ) for recent publications.

### üß™ Software Projects

- **[MetaMorpheus](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus)**: Core developer of this open-source search engine for proteomics and RNA modification analysis. I contribute to backend algorithms and WPF GUI features.
- **[MzLib](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/mzLib) & [Related Libraries](https://github.com/nbollis/MetaAnalyzer)**: Developer and maintainer of modular .NET libraries supporting mass spectrometry workflows, with emphasis on testability and reusability.
- **Transcriptomics Extensions**: Developer of workflows for modified RNA oligonucleotide analysis alongside standard peptide searches.

### üõ†Ô∏è Personal Projects

Beyond my research and scientific tools, I enjoy building practical and fun software projects to learn new skills, including:

- üÉè **[Solitaire Solver with Genetic Algorithms](https://github.com/nbollis/Solivtare)**  
  A simulation environment for evolving and testing solitaire strategies using genetic algorithms and automated game state evaluation.

- üé≤ **[Board Game Stats Tracker](https://github.com/nbollis/FourSoulsStatsTracker)**  
  A stats tracker for tabletop games, designed to log game outcomes, player performance, and generate fun historical summaries.

- üç≤ **[Recipe Management Software](https://github.com/nbollis/TheKitchen)**  
  A desktop app to organize, categorize, and scale personal and family recipes with intuitive meal planning tools.
